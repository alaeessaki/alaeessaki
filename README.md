### Hello 👋

I'm a full-stack JAVA/Angular web developper and currently working as a consultant at Pragmatic/IT6 Consulting.

I blog from time to time about tutorials and developpement stuff. You can find me on Medium @alaeessaki and Twitter.

When I am not coding you can find me Reading Manga or translating novels.

The best way to contact me for a quick question is on my LinkedIn profile.

Feel free to reach out to me for speaking inquiries, or if you have questions or comments feel free to email me at alaeessaki@gmail.com
